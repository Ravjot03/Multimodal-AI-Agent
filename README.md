# Multimodal AI Agent for Web Search and Stock Analysis

This project demonstrates a multimodal AI agent setup that integrates different AI models and tools for web searching and stock analysis. The AI agents use the Groq model (powered by Llama-3.3-70b) to gather and analyze information from web search engines (DuckDuckGo) and financial data sources (Yahoo Finance) in a highly collaborative manner.
